# 🧠 Kaggle Learning Playground: Prediction Competition

This repository contains solutions to various Kaggle Playground Prediction Competitions. These competitions are ideal for learning and practicing data science techniques in a structured and hands-on way.

📂 Contents
Each folder or notebook in this repo corresponds to a specific Kaggle Playground competition. My approach typically includes:

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- 🧠 Model Training & Tuning (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Neural Networks)
- 🔁 Cross-Validation
- 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- 📝 Submission File Creation
- 💡 Purpose


I created this repository to:

- Improve my machine learning workflow through real-world problems
- Build a consistent and organized practice structure
- Explore new models, tools, and evaluation strategies
- Track progress in Kaggle competitions

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/Developer-107/Kaggle_Learning_Playground_Prediction_Competition.git
- Navigate to a specific competition folder.
- Install required dependencies (usually via pip install inside the notebooks).
- Download datasets (if not included) directly from the respective Kaggle competition pages.


🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

Kaggle API

📌 Notes
Solutions are implemented from scratch and reflect my own understanding.

- All notebooks are part of my personal learning journey.
- I continuously iterate and improve models over time.
